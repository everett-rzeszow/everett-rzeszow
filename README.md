Hello. Thank you for stopping in.

I am a graduate student at University of Maine's School of Marine Sciences in the Marine Biology program. 
I graduated from Bowdoin College with a B.A. in Earth and Oceanographic Studies May 2021.

My research focuses on modelling small scale lobster population dynamics using catch data. To accomplish this I survey sites (~ 1 x 1 km.) from commercial fishing vessels using randomly stratified trap placement and multiple trap types. Lobsters are tagged to complete mark-recapture analysis using both the adujested Schnabel and Jolly-Cormack-Seber models.

This survey fits into a larger before-after control-impact (BACI) project in which the effect of installation and operation of a floating commercial scale wind turbine on the local commercial lobster fishery will be investigated.
